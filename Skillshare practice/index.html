        <div class="modal-content">The West Highland Way. (Scottish Gaelic: Slighe na GÃ idhealtachd an Iar) is a linear long-distance route in Scotland. 
            It is 154 km (96 miles) long, running from Milngavie north of Glasgow to Fort William in the Scottish Highlands, 
            with an element of hill walking in the route. The trail, which opened in 1980, 
            was Scotland's first officially designated Long Distance Route, and is now designated by NatureScot 
            as one of Scotland's Great Trails. It is primarily intended as a long distance walking route, 
            and whilst many sections are suitable for mountain biking and horseriding there are obstacles 
            and surfaces that will require these users to dismount in places.</div>
